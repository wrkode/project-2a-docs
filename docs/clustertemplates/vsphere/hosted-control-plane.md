# Hosted control plane (k0smotron) deployment

## Prerequisites

- Management Kubernetes cluster (v1.28+) deployed on vSphere with HMC installed
  on it

Keep in mind that all control plane components for all managed clusters will
reside in the management cluster.


## ManagedCluster manifest

Hosted CP template has mostly identical parameters with standalone CP, you can
check them in the [template parameters](template-parameters.md) section.

> NOTE: **Important Note on Control Plane Endpoint IP Address**
> The vSphere provider requires the control plane endpoint IP to be specified
> before deploying the cluster. Ensure that this IP matches the IP assigned to
> the k0smotron load balancer (LB) service. Provide the control plane endpoint
> IP to the k0smotron service via an annotation accepted by your LB provider
> (e.g., the `kube-vip` annotation in the example below).
